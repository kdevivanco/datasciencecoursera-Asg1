# IMPORTANT!!! -->> I was having trouble reading the specdata file as is so I passed all the .csv files to my working directory project!! this is why when I call the function
# I set my directory to "getwd()" instead of "specdata". 


# this is the most difficult question bc of using a corr function that I had never seen before, and it wasnt in the lectures/videos
# the first thing to do is read the function documentation

?corr
#Â cor(x, y = NULL, use = "everything",
#    method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))

# I still didnt understand so I searched the web for info, I recommend doing the same thing ... 
# It is also important to understand the instructions: of all complete cases>0 we want the correlation btwn nitrate and sulfate for any given ID 
# lets start... 

corr<- function(directory, threshold = 0) {
# differently to Q1 and Q3, I specified the path bc of problems running the functions in previous tests:
  datacorr <- list.files(path = "/home/rstudio/Week 2/ASSIGNMENT - Air Quality") 
  # Result vector created for storing the results...
  result <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 0) 
  
  for(i in 1:332) ## 1:332 <- IDS, dont know why IDs wasnt working as a variable so I textually assinged the number of files as so
  {
  ## first we need to clean the data from NA values
    cleandata <- na.omit(read.csv(datacorr[i]))
   #if cleandata is greater than the threshold (0) it is considered
   if( nrow(cleandata) > threshold ) {
      ## I applied the cor function for both pollutants... 
      corvector <- cor(cleandata$sulfate, cleandata$nitrate)
      result <- append(result,corvector) #used append function to store values as list
    }
  }
  ## return the result
  result
} 

#test the function...
